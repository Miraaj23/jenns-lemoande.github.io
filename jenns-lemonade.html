            <h1>Jenn's Story</h1>
            <p>Jenn began her lemonade empire one hot and sunny day in July of 1999, with her only product being fresh lemonade.</p>
            <div><quote>"I really wanted a doll that I had seen at a local toy store, but my parents didn't have the most money, so I decided to earn money save up for it."</quote></div>
            <p>Inspired by her grandmother's homemade lemonade that she made every 4th of July, Jenn decided to sell lemonade in order to save up for that doll.</p>
            <div><quote>"I didn't even know how to make lemonade, so I had to call my grandmother and ask her how she does it. It was more work than I thought it would be!"</quote></div>
            <p>After a couple hours,Jenn was able to perfect her grandmother's lemonade &amp; she set up a chair and table with a sign taped to the front advertising her lemonade for just a dollar a cup.</p>
            <div><quote>I didn't really make much the first day, even week, but I made at least 3-5 dollars a day &amp; that was enough to keep me going.</quote></div>
